"""Shared test setup: the suite runs headless, so it needs no display and no session of its own.

`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` is assigned before Qt is imported - an assignment, never `setdefault`,
because a desktop session already exports `wayland;xcb`. One `QApplication` is built for the whole
run (session-wide, autouse): building a second one takes the first one's widgets down. `rtmidi` is
swapped for a fake port and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`XDG_DATA_HOME` point at a temp directory, so no test
opens a real synth or touches the developer's own settings. No test may need a display or an audio
device.
