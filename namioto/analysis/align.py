"""Forced alignment of known lyrics against a separated vocal: CTC posteriors + Viterbi.

The core is FA-Kara's (MIT, see NOTICE): a line's tokens are forced onto the frames of a wav2vec2
CTC model, and each token gets the span of frames it won. The model never recognises anything, it
only says where the tokens it is given fall, and it arrives as a converted ONNX graph, so torch and
torchaudio stay out of the program. Two models can be exported: `mms` (Meta's MMS forced-alignment
checkpoint) and `yohane` (`NextFire/mms-300m-ForcedAligner-karaoke-ja-Latn`). Both read a romanised
lyrics; `namioto.utils.kana_tokens` turns a `.krc` line's kana into those tokens.

The alignment itself is a numpy port of torchaudio's `forced_align`/`merge_tokens` (BSD-2-Clause,
see NOTICE). A line's tokens are flattened into their characters, each character is one CTC target,
and a target's frames are merged into its span; the spans are grouped back into one per token. Only
a token's start is worth reading: a CTC target's end is the next target's onset, so the last one
before a rest reaches into the rest.

The caller passes a window per line; the aligner can only refine a window, never find one, and a
window that does not hold the line's voice still comes back with times, from a path the model
barely supports - which is what `problems()` is for.

A whole song is not run in one pass: `ChunkedBackend` walks it in overlapping chunks, because a
wav2vec2 graph attends over its whole input and one pass is quadratic in frames; the `chunk`
parameter of `PARAMETERS` (on by default) turns that off. The model's pass is cached on its own
(`save_emissions`/`load_emissions`, keyed without the lyrics, since the encoder never sees them) and
the raw run beside it (`save_alignment`/`find_alignment`), so a changed lyric re-runs only the CTC
search. The run is fitted to the voice the way FA-Kara does (`correct_times`).
