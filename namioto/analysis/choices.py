"""The values a setting may take, kept apart from the modules that run them.

`namioto.settings` and `namioto.project` read these to build their spec tables, and building one must
not import the analysis stack: `namioto.project` reads the settings, and reading a project should not
pull librosa and scipy in. The module that runs an option imports its list from here and so still
offers the same name.
