"""Where the ONNX models come from: one registry, one order of search, one downloader.

The program ships no model: every one of them is fetched into the data directory on demand. A family
keeps its own keys and its own files - GAME a size, the aligner a model and a language - while the
order they are looked up in, the download that puts them there and the session opened on them are
the same for all of them. A family is looked up as an explicit path, its environment variable, an
installed copy under `models/`, then the release it names; the first file of a family is what a
downloaded package is recognized by.

This module does not import ONNX Runtime of its own: the runtime is optional and is reached only
when a session is opened, so importing this module never pulls it into the GUI's startup path.
