"""Where a model runs: one registry of the devices the program can offer.

A device names the ONNX Runtime providers that put a model on it, the runtime a person would have to
install and what to do when that runtime is missing. The settings spec reads the keys and labels,
`model_store` its provider lists, the settings window asks `available` / `missing` whether the
runtime is there, `validate` says whether a run can open a model at all, and a run's CPU/GPU choice
is turned into a device key by `resolve`. ONNX Runtime is imported only inside `installed` and
`validate`, so the GUI's startup path stays free of it. A provider that ships as a plugin is named
by its module in `plugin`; it has to be registered before the runtime offers it, which `installed`
does as a side effect.
