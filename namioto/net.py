"""Outbound requests: the GitHub mirror and the proxy, read from the settings when a call is made.

Every address the program fetches on its own goes through here - a release download and the lyrics
API alike - so the two settings have one meaning wherever a request is built. `mirrored` puts the
GitHub mirror in front of a github.com address, and `opener` is the `urlopen`-shaped callable the
proxy setting asks for. Reading the settings at call time, rather than once at import, is what lets
a change take effect without a restart. Qt-free on purpose.
