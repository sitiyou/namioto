"""The project file: the notes, the audio they were drawn over, and the values that go with them.

Plain UTF-8 JSON, so a project can be read, diffed and edited by hand; the only thing that would need
a binary container is the spectrum, and reanalysing a five-minute file takes about a second.

Qt-free on purpose. Notes are stored in seconds and rounded to a tenth of a millisecond: seconds are
what the editor anchors them to, so a different tempo moves the grid, not the notes.

`ProjectSettings` holds the values that describe a song - how it is analysed, drawn and played back -
and the table below is their single source of truth. They are the project's alone: the program's own
preferences are in `namioto.settings`, and the window's state in `namioto.state`. A field marked
`reuse` is the exception - its last value says more about the user than about the song - so the
window keeps every change the user makes to one in `namioto.state`, and the next document starts
from it.

`Lyrics` carries the `.krc` text itself (the baseline), the aligned times keyed by a hash of that
text, and the mode. A same-named `.krc` beside the project is a working copy the editor keeps in
step; it is never validated.
