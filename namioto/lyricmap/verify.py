"""The one gate every lyric export passes through: the issues that block it, and the canonical `.krc`.

A button, a colour or a caught exception must never decide on its own whether a mapping may leave the
editor, so the KRC and the subtitle both ask this. It reports locatable problems - a filtered note, a
low-confidence operation, an anchor that no longer holds, a merge the format cannot write - and, when
nothing is wrong, hands back the canonical `.krc` the subtitle is generated from. Qt-free.
