"""Read-only mode: the `.krc`'s own `.N`, groups and `.+` lay the Sounds out, with nothing estimated.

This is not the edit mapping and shares none of its state: the input's NOTE slots are read in order,
never solved for. `note_groups` reads the literal mapping, including continuations, into runs of
Sounds and their NOTE counts. Sounds sharing one NOTE divide it equally; one Sound taking several
holds their whole span. When the notes run out the rest have no time to render. Qt-free.
