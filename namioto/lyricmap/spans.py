"""The time each Sound is drawn at, derived from the mapping - never stored as fact.

A match spans its first note's start to its last note's end; a merge splits its one note evenly
between its Sounds, so the members tile the note instead of each covering the whole of it; a drop has
no block at all. This is the only place the derived span is computed, so the roll and the subtitle
read the same times. Qt-free.
