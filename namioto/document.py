"""The score a session edits: the notes and the MIDI channels they play on.

Qt-free on purpose, like channels.py and project.py: the roll draws it, the players and the project
file read it, and nothing here knows about a widget or a scene. Notes are timed in beats, the unit
the roll works in; the seconds a file or the audio uses are a conversion at that boundary, not a
second home for the data.

`MIN_DURATION` (a 64th note) is the floor this model keeps, so only a file may bring a note shorter
than that. `OVERLAP_SLACK` is the resolution below which two notes of one voice count as touching.
