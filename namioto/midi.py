"""MIDI files: reading them into notes and channels, and writing those back out.

Qt-free on purpose, like project.py and settings.py. mido is a file codec here and nothing else: no
port is ever opened, so a machine with no sound card and a test read and write the same.

A file's track chunks are not kept: a channel is what a note plays on, so every channel with notes
becomes one entry, and one MTrk holding several channels is read as several. Names ride on a track
chunk, not on a channel, so none is read or written - they belong to the project file.

Notes are stored in seconds, as everywhere else in the project, so the tempo map of a file is walked
on the way in and written as the one tempo the grid has on the way out.
