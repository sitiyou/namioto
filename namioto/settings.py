"""The program's own preferences: what it remembers between runs, and the file it keeps them in.

Qt-free on purpose. The table below is the whole set: a value the user can change about the program
itself, never about a song. A document's values belong to `namioto.project`, and the window's own
state to `namioto.state`, so nothing here has to say whether it is remembered or for one file.

`namioto.ui.settings_dialog` builds its pages from this table without repeating anything, and the
`Section`s that get a page are named in that window; `editor` has no page, so its two switches are
kept and never typed in. A value read from the file is checked by `namioto.params.coerce`, which
brings a bad one back in line.
