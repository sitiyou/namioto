"""The authoritative mapping: one `match`, `merge` or `drop` per run of the line's Sounds.

A `SoundRef` names a Sound the way `natural_sounds` counts it: its line and its index within the
line. `Match` consumes `1..N` consecutive notes with one Sound, `Merge` consumes one note with `2..N`
consecutive Sounds, `Drop` consumes no note. Together the operations of a song are a partition - every
Sound is in exactly one, every note in exactly one `Match` or `Merge` - and that partition is the
mapping everything else is derived from. Qt-free.
