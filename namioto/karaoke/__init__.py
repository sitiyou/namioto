"""Karaoke: the `.krc` lyric model, and what reads, writes and times it.

`model.py` holds the tree (`Word`/`Ruby`/`Line`/`Chapter`/`Lyrics`), `parser.parse` reads a `.krc`
into it, `writer.dumps` writes an edited tree back out, `transforms` holds the optional passes over
one, `sounds.py` reads a lyric as its natural Sounds, `canonical.py` rebuilds a `.krc` from a
mapping, `operations.py` holds the mapping's operations, and `ass` writes the subtitle those Sounds
time. The whole package is Qt-free; the names it re-exports are its public surface.
