"""The natural Sounds of a `.krc`: one pronunciation atom each, before any mapping is read.

A Sound is what the lyrics are actually sung as: one kana, or a kana with the small kana riding it,
a long vowel or sokuon of its own, one run of Latin letters, one digit. Punctuation and whitespace
carry no Sound. The input `.N` and the input `(...)` are ignored here - they say how the file was
mapped to notes, not how it reads - so a `(しょう)` reads `しょ`, `う` and a `(しょ)` reads `しょ`.
`.+` also leaves the natural stream unchanged; `note_groups` reads the literal mapping separately.

Each Sound keeps the minimal writable container it came from - a run of the line's top-level units,
or one part of a ruby - and the range of source characters it covers there, so a later pass can write
a `.N` back onto exactly the characters it reads. The token is the one hepburn token the aligner
reads, and the whole line's tokens are the token stream the aligner is given. Qt-free.
