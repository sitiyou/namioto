"""The strips that share the roll's columns.

The roll's ruler and keyboard and the lyrics strip all read the view's scroll position rather than
keeping one of their own, so a strip and the roll never drift apart. The view is typed as a
`QGraphicsView` on purpose: the strip only needs its viewport, and the concrete view lives in
`namioto.ui.roll`, which imports this module.
