"""The pointer grammar the notes and the lyrics morae share.

Both editors draw a timed block over the roll's shared time axis and answer the pointer the same
way: an edge resizes the block, its body moves it, and a press stays a click - narrowing the
selection - until it travels past `CLICK_SLOP_PX`. The block and the constraints on its span stay
with each editor; only the hit test and the click/drag boundary live here.
