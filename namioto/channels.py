"""The channels a note plays on: one MIDI channel per entry, with the values it plays with.

Qt-free on purpose, like project.py and settings.py: the project file reads and writes these, the
players receive their playback values, and only the UI draws them. Notes never live here — they
carry the channel number and stay in one flat sequence.

`CHANNEL_COUNT` is 16 and the drum channel is a channel like any other. No name is kept here: a
library name rides on a MIDI track chunk and may repeat, so names live in the project file alone.
`GM_PROGRAMS` is the General MIDI instrument a program number selects, in that number's order, and
`PROGRAM_LABELS` is those names as a picker shows them.
